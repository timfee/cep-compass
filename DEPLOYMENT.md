## Overview

CEP Compass is a Chrome Enterprise Policy management application built with Angular 20+ and Firebase.

## Pre-deployment Checklist

### Code Quality ✅

- [x] All lint errors fixed (0 issues)
- [x] TypeScript strict mode enabled
- [x] Modern Angular patterns (standalone components, signals, control flow)
- [x] OnPush change detection strategy

### Performance Optimization ✅

- [x] Lazy loading implemented for feature modules
- [x] Bundle size optimized (1.17MB vs previous 1.40MB)
- [x] Tree shaking enabled
- [x] Production build configuration

### Security ✅

- [x] Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- [x] Security meta tags (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
- [x] Environment-based configuration
- [x] Global error handler for production monitoring

### Production Configuration ✅

- [x] Environment files for dev/prod separation
- [x] Firebase configuration externalized
- [x] Error reporting framework ready
- [x] Production-specific optimizations

## Build Commands

### Development Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build --configuration=production
```

### Local Development

```bash
npm start
```

## Firebase Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. Login: `firebase login`
3. Initialize project: `firebase init`

### Deploy to Firebase Hosting

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build --configuration=production

# Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Deploy Functions (if applicable)

```bash
# Deploy cloud functions
firebase deploy --only functions
```

## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment

- Located in `src/environments/environment.ts`
- Development-specific settings (debug logging, etc.)

### Production Environment

- Located in `src/environments/environment.prod.ts`
- Production optimizations enabled
- Error reporting enabled
- Analytics enabled

## Security Considerations

### Content Security Policy

The application includes a restrictive CSP that:

- Allows scripts only from self and Google APIs
- Restricts external resources to trusted domains
- Prevents inline scripts and eval()
- Blocks framing (X-Frame-Options: DENY)

### Firebase Security Rules

Ensure your Firebase security rules are properly configured for production:

- Authenticate users before access
- Validate data on write operations
- Implement proper role-based access control

## Monitoring & Error Reporting

### Global Error Handler

The application includes a global error handler that:

- Logs all unhandled errors
- Reports errors to monitoring service in production
- Captures user context and stack traces

### Recommended Monitoring Services

- **Error Tracking**: Sentry, LogRocket, or Firebase Crashlytics
- **Performance**: Google Analytics, Firebase Performance
- **User Behavior**: Firebase Analytics

## Performance Monitoring

### Bundle Analysis

```bash
# Analyze bundle size
npm run build -- --stats-json
npx webpack-bundle-analyzer dist/myapp/stats.json
```

### Key Metrics

- Initial bundle: 1.17MB (down from 1.40MB)
- Gzipped transfer: ~266KB
- Lazy-loaded features: ~44KB average

## Browser Support

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 90+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Deployment Best Practices

1. **Always run tests before deployment**
2. **Use environment-specific configurations**
3. **Monitor error rates post-deployment**
4. **Implement proper caching strategies**
5. **Use Firebase Hosting for automatic SSL/CDN**

## Rollback Strategy

Firebase Hosting maintains deployment history:

```bash
# View deployment history
firebase hosting:releases

# Rollback to previous version
firebase hosting:rollback
```

## Support & Maintenance

- Monitor Firebase console for errors
- Review performance metrics regularly
- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow Angular update guide for framework updates
