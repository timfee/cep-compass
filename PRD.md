# CEP Compass - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

CEP Compass is a comprehensive web-based administration platform for Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) programs within educational institutions. The platform enables administrators to manage student enrollment, communicate with families, track directory statistics, and ensure program compliance through role-based access control and Google Workspace integration.

## Product Vision

To provide educational administrators with a unified, secure, and user-friendly platform for managing all aspects of their CEP programs, reducing administrative burden while ensuring compliance and improving communication with families.

## Core Problems

1. **Fragmented Administration**: Schools currently use multiple disconnected tools for enrollment, communication, and reporting
2. **Manual Processes**: Heavy reliance on paper forms and manual data entry
3. **Limited Access Control**: Difficulty managing who can access and modify sensitive student data
4. **Communication Gaps**: No centralized system for reaching families with program updates
5. **Compliance Tracking**: Manual tracking of eligibility and participation rates

## Target Users
